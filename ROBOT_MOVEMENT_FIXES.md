## üîß Motor Speed Calibration System

### Motor Layout
```
    FRONT
[A]     [B]
 ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
 ‚îÇ  ü§ñ  ‚îÇ
 ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ
[C]     [D]
    BACK

A = Front Left Motor
B = Front Right Motor  
C = Back Left Motor
D = Back Right Motor
```

### Speed Adjustment Logic
- **Robot turns RIGHT during forward**: Reduce speeds of motors B and D (right side)
- **Robot turns LEFT during forward**: Reduce speeds of motors A and C (left side)
- **Speed range**: 50-255 (50 = minimum, 255 = maximum)
- **Default speeds**: All motors start at 200

## üöÄ How to Fix Circular Movement

### Method 1: Interactive Calibration (Recommended)
```bash
python3 motor_calibration_tool.py
```

**Steps:**
1. Select option `3` (Straight Line Calibration)
2. Place robot in open space
3. Watch movement direction during test
4. Follow prompts to adjust motor speeds
5. Test improvements and fine-tune
6. Save calibration settings

### Method 2: Manual Calibration in Code
```python
from motor_control import MotorController

# Initialize motor controller
motor = MotorController()

# Example: Robot turns right, so reduce right motors
motor.calibrate_motor_speeds(
    front_left=200,   # Motor A - keep same
    front_right=170,  # Motor B - reduce by 30
    back_left=200,    # Motor C - keep same  
    back_right=170    # Motor D - reduce by 30
)

# Test movement
motor.forward(3.0)  # Move forward for 3 seconds
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Diagnostic Tools

### Individual Motor Test
```python
# Test each motor separately to identify wiring issues
motor.test_individual_motors()
```

### Movement Pattern Analysis
```python
# Comprehensive movement testing
motor.test_movement_patterns()
```

### Auto-Calibration Helper
```python
# Guided calibration with instructions
motor.auto_calibrate_straight_movement()
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

| **Problem** | **Likely Cause** | **Solution** |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Robot turns right | Right motors too fast | Reduce speeds of motors B & D |
| Robot turns left | Left motors too fast | Reduce speeds of motors A & C |
| One motor not working | Wiring/connection issue | Check connections, test individually |
| Jerky movement | Speed differences too large | Use smaller adjustments (10-20) |
| No movement | Power/Arduino issue | Check power supply and connections |

### Speed Adjustment Guidelines
- **Small adjustments**: 10-20 speed units for fine-tuning
- **Medium adjustments**: 20-40 for noticeable corrections  
- **Large adjustments**: 40+ for major corrections (be careful)
- **Minimum speed**: Never go below 50 (motors may stall)

## üìä Safety Features

### Movement Limits
- **Maximum continuous time**: 5.0 seconds (prevents runaway)
- **Default duration**: 1.5 seconds (safer for testing)
- **Emergency stop**: Immediate motor shutdown capability

### Non-Blocking Operation
- All movements run in separate threads
- Speech recognition not interrupted
- Face tracking continues during movement

## üéØ Testing Your Calibration

### Quick Test Sequence
```python
from motor_control import MotorController

motor = MotorController()

# Test forward movement (should go straight)
motor.forward(2.0)

# Test backward movement (should go straight back)  
motor.backward(2.0)

# Test turns (should turn in place)
motor.left(1.0)
motor.right(1.0)

# Emergency stop if needed
motor.emergency_stop()
```

### Calibration Verification
1. **Forward test**: Place robot in open area, run `motor.forward(3.0)`
2. **Measure deviation**: Robot should travel in straight line
3. **Acceptable tolerance**: Less than 30¬∞ deviation over 3 seconds
4. **Fine-tune**: Adjust speeds based on direction of drift

## üíæ Saving Your Settings

### Save Calibration to File
```python
# Using the calibration tool
python3 motor_calibration_tool.py
# Select option 6: Save Calibration Settings
```

### Load Settings in Your Code
```python
# Apply your calibrated speeds
motor.calibrate_motor_speeds(
    front_left=185,   # Your calibrated values
    front_right=190,
    back_left=180,
    back_right=195
)
```

## üîß Integration with Face Tracking

The motor controller is designed to work seamlessly with your face tracking system:

```python
from face_tracking_integration import RealTimeEnhancedFaceTrackingIntegration

# Initialize face tracking with calibrated movements
face_tracker = RealTimeEnhancedFaceTrackingIntegration(
    headless=True,  # No camera preview
    motor_controller=motor  # Uses calibrated speeds
)

# Start tracking (movements will be accurate now)
face_tracker.start_tracking()
```

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### If Robot Moves Erratically
```python
# Immediate stop
motor.emergency_stop()

# Reset to safe defaults
motor.calibrate_motor_speeds(
    front_left=150,
    front_right=150, 
    back_left=150,
    back_right=150
)
```

### If Calibration Gets Worse
```python
# Reset to defaults and start over
motor.calibrate_motor_speeds(
    front_left=200,
    front_right=200,
    back_left=200, 
    back_right=200
)
```

## üéâ Expected Results

After calibration, your robot should:
- ‚úÖ Move in **straight lines** during forward/backward
- ‚úÖ Turn **in place** during left/right commands
- ‚úÖ Respond **consistently** to movement commands
- ‚úÖ Work **safely** with automatic timeouts
- ‚úÖ Integrate **smoothly** with face tracking

## üìû Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. **Run diagnostics**: Use the calibration tool's test functions
2. **Check hardware**: Verify all motor connections
3. **Test individually**: Use individual motor tests
4. **Start simple**: Begin with default speeds and small adjustments
5. **Document results**: Save working calibrations for backup

---

**Remember**: Small, iterative adjustments work better than large changes. Test after each adjustment and save settings that work well!
